With Ubuntu MaaS setup and tftp settings setup to allow you to network boot any machines. you can follow along with these Terraform setup and apply configs. 

#### Configuring Terraform with Proxmox

As of the last update to this documentation the most recent Telmate/Proxmox plugin version for terraform is `2.9.11` to use this new version you will need a provider with the following structure.

```yml
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1.0"
  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source  = "telmate/proxmox"
      version = "2.9.11"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  pm_api_url          = "https://:8006/api2/json"
  pm_api_token_id     = ""
  pm_api_token_secret = ""
  pm_tls_insecure     = true
}
```

from above we have the terraform plugin setup script, this will tell terraform to download the plugin source `telmate/proxmox`, with version `2.9.11` and then set some provide details.

`pm_api_url` this needs to be either you only proxmox node, or a node that is connected to your cluster. an example would be `https://192.168.1.2:8006/api2/json` this will be where Terraform invokes its vm create, modify and destroy commands.

`pm_api_token_id` this is the id you gave to a new user for api access as per the image below you will need the username@realm so for me its packer@pam

`pm_api_token_secret` is the secret generated by adding a new token. In the second windows you see the Secret this goes into the `pm_api_token_secret`28f54f16-af19-4d91-8a2a-2687c57e2905
